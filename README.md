# I Built an AI Multimodal Stock-Price-Prediction System from Scratch. Now I'm Open-Sourcing It.

When large language models emerged into our lives, I had a realization: the same AI architecture used for language models could be used to predict stock prices.

With over 20 years in financial markets but no prior AI/ML experience, I embarked on a journey to self-teach AI/ML and Python using online resources. Progressing from zero relevant coding experience to deploying a production-ready transformer architecture system in 9 months.

The system evolved from single-modality to multimodal architecture, enabling combination of price data with timestamps, volume, indicators, and multi-asset inputs. Built to handle cross-attention mechanisms and configurable processing pipelines using YAML-based modality configuration.

After extensive testing on financial data, predictions didn't consistently achieve the profitability threshold I needed for live trading. However, the system handles any time-series data (equities, commodities, currencies, or non-financial data), and since I can't explore all possibilities, I'm open-sourcing it.

Configure as needed (includes comprehensive documentation and examples), use your own data, or further develop the architecture. The right data combination might be out thereâ€”maybe you'll find it.

A special shout-out to Andrej Karpathy for his video "Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out." It was a game-changer, proving that building such a system was indeed doable.
